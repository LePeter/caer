WINDOWS BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================
We support building cAER on the Windows platform by using the MinGW32/64 compilers
and the MSYS2 environment. Following are detailed step-by-step instructions to install
the required components and get everything building, we use MinGW64 here for the
64-bit Windows platform, if you want to build for 32-bit Windows, just replace all
mentions of 'x86_64' with 'i686'. Whenever you want to install a package, use
the MSYS2 shell, while to build code, use the MinGW32/64 shells!

1) Install the MSYS2 environment, the MinGW64 compiler and libcaer and all its
dependencies as described in detail in libcaer's 'README.Windows'.

2) Install the required dependencies: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libuv

3) Install any additional dependencies as required: pacman -S <pkg-name>
 Input/Output modules: mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
 Visualizer module: mingw-w64-x86_64-allegro mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype mingw-w64-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
 CameraCalibration, PoseEstimation modules: mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv

4) Install Mini-XML manually:
 a) Download the latest version from http://www.msweet.org/downloads.php?L+Z3 (currently 2.10).
 b) Unpack it: tar -xvzf mxml-2.10.tar.gz
 c) Switch to the source directory: cd mxml-2.10/
 d) Copy the patch needed to compile it under MinGW and apply it: patch -p1 < mxml-mingw-compile.patch
    You can find the patch in the cAER source checkout, inside the ext/ directory.
 e) Configure: CFLAGS="-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1" ./configure --prefix=/mingw64/
 f) Make: make
 g) Install: make install

5) Place the cAER source in a location easily accessible to MSYS2. We usually
put the source code into 'C:\msys64\home\caer\' and use TortoiseGit
(https://tortoisegit.org/) or git from the MSYS2 shell (pacman -S git) to get it.

6) Switch to the cAER checkout directory: cd /home/caer/

7) Configure, run CMake: cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw64 -DDAVISFX2=1 -DENABLE_BAFILTER=1 .
Change this to suit your needs, by enabling/disabling the proper modules!

8) Build, run Make: make

9) Install: make install

Congratulations, you now have a working cAER on Windows!
