Release 1.1.0 - 05.12.2017
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- Dynap-SE: biasing has been cleaned up, please use the functions
  caerDynapseGetBiasCore() and caerDynapseSetBiasCore() from dynapse_utils.h
  to get/set biases from other modules. No other functions to do this
  are supported. The configuration path for biases changed to be more
  clearly laid out and is now: 'bias/Ux/Cy/<BiasName>/'.
  Also the software spike generator is now its own module, called
  'softspikegen'. The 'fpgaspikegen' and 'poissonspikegen' modules have
  been ported to the new modules system. The 'monitorneufilter' module is
  now directly integrated as part of the main Dynap-SE device input module.
- Modules: we are shifting to a SDK-like system. Most non-core modules
  have been moved to a private repository. Please contact us for access.
- Dependencies: requires libcaer 2.4.0. mini-xml is not needed anymore,
  and libuv is only needed for the misc/out/ modules. Removal of this
  dependency is tracked in issue #73. Also the Boost.iostreams package
  is now required, in addition to system, filesystem and program_options.
  The SLRE dependency in SSHS has also been removed in favor of std::regex.
- License: changed license from GPL-2 to LGPL-2.1 to allow for closed
  source plugins/modules.
- Devices/Inputs: removed 'highestTimestamp' sourceInfo node attribute for
  input devices and modules. It was not being used anywhere.

NEW FEATURES
- Documentation: added several XML configuration examples in docs/.
- Modules: added 'description' field to 'struct caer_module_info'.
- Modules: modules can now wait, using caerMainloopGetModuleInputIDs(),
  for their inputs to be ready.
- SSHS: rewritten in C++, added sshsAttributeReadModifier callback
  to influence values returned when reading attributes.
- SSHS: added sshsNodeCreateAttributePollTime(), sshsNodeCreateAttributeListOptions()
  and sshsNodeCreateAttributeFileChooser() functions to create
  informative attributes, to be used by GUIs and clients.
- Visualizer: rewritten to use C++ and the SFML libraries. This now
  works on MacOS X too. Fixes issue #92.
- mainloop.cpp: order modules in such a way to minimize event packets
  needing to be copied around (performance improvement).
- mainloop.h: added caerMainloopGetModuleNode() function.
- netparser: network parser module for Dynap-SE.

BUG FIXES
- mainloop.cpp: fixed various issues with module order generation.
  Fixes issues #121, #112, #107.
- sshs_node.cpp: fixed various memory problems, issues #120, #119,
  #118, #117, and #93.
- Boost: improved compatibility with older 1.5X versions.
- module.cpp: changed separation character for multiple modules search
  paths in the 'modulesSearchPath' attribute to '|' instead of ':'.
  This is needed for Windows compatibility.
- Input modules: correctly recognize Dynap-SE files, fixes issue #128.


Release 1.0.1 - 03.07.2017 (ChangeLog incomplete)
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- Visualizer: cannot work on MacOS X due to how the Allegro5 library
  implementes initialization by overriding main(). Trying to enable
  the visualizer on MacOS X results in an error now.

NEW FEATURES
- Docs: new 'docs/modules.txt' document to describe modules system.
- Input/Output modules: use caerModuleLog() where possible.
- caer-bin: now supports several command-line options, -h/--help to get
  a help text, -c/--config to specify an alternative XML configuration
  file, and -o/--override to override a specific configuration parameter
  that was loaded from the XML configuration file.
- DAVIS: added support for automatic exposure control via libcaer.

BUG FIXES
- Windows: plugins can now successfully link against the symbols the
  executable provides, by generating a special DLL import library.
- MacOS X: fixed undefined references in plugins during linking.
- MacOS X: also search for modules in files with .dylib extension.
- SSHS: when importing nodes and attributes from XML files, create them
  with SSHS_FLAGS_NORMAL instead of SSHS_FLAGS_READ_ONLY, to allow
  modification by internal users.
- README: added Boost dependency to documentation.


Release 1.0.0 - 28.04.2017
- Initial 1.X branch release. Uses libcaer 2.0.2. Supports DVS128, DAVIS and
  Dynap-se devices, as well as AEDAT 3.1 input/output via files and network.
  New modules system, see 'docs/modules.txt' and 'README.porting'.
