/*
 * Here we handle all outputs in a common way, taking in event packets
 * as input and writing a buffer to a file descriptor as output.
 * The main-loop part is responsible for gathering the event packets,
 * copying them and their events (valid or not depending on configuration),
 * and putting them on a transfer ring-buffer. A second thread, called the
 * output handler, gets the packet groups from there, orders them according
 * to the AEDAT 3.X format specification, and breaks them up into chunks as
 * directed to write() them to a file descriptor efficiently (buffered I/O).
 * The AEDAT 3.X format specification specifically states that there is no
 * relation at all between packets from different sources at the output level,
 * that they behave as if independent, which we do here to simplify the system
 * considerably: one output module (or Sink) can only work with packets from
 * one source. Multiple sources will have to go to multiple output modules!
 * The other stipulation in the AEDAT 3.X specifications is on ordering of
 * events from the same source: the first timestamp of a packet determines
 * its order in the packet stream, from smallest timestamp to largest, which
 * is the logical increasing time ordering you'd expect.
 * This kind of ordering is useful and simplifies reading back data later on;
 * if you read a packet of type A with TS A-TS1, when you next read a packet of
 * the same type A, with TS A-TS2, you know you must also have read all other
 * events, of this AND all other present types, with a timestamp between A-TS1
 * and (A-TS2 - 1). This makes time-based reading and replaying of data very easy
 * and efficient, so time-slice playback or real-time playback get relatively
 * simple to implement. Data-amount based playback is always relatively easy.
 * Now, outputting event packets in this particular order from an output module
 * requires some additional processing: before you can write out packet A with TS
 * A-TS1, you need to be sure no other packets with a timestamp equal or smaller
 * to A-TS1 can come afterwards (the only solution would be to discard them at
 * that point to maintain the correct ordering, and you'd want to avoid that).
 * We cannot assume a constant and quick data flow, since at any point during a
 * recording, data producers can be turned off, packet size etc. configuration
 * changed, or some events, like Special ones, are rare to begin with during
 * normal camera operation (one approx. every 35 minutes).
 * But we'd like to write data continuously and as soon as possible!
 * Thankfully cAER/libcaer come to the rescue thanks to a small but important
 * detail of how input modules are implemented (input modules are all those
 * modules that create new data in some way, also called a Source).
 * They either create sequences of single packets, where the ordering is trivial,
 * or so called 'Packet Containers', which do offer timestamp-related guarantees.
 * From the libcaer/events/packetContainer.h documentation:
 *
 * "An EventPacketContainer is a logical construct that contains packets
 * of events (EventPackets) of different event types, with the aim of
 * keeping related events of differing types, such as DVS and IMU data,
 * together. Such a relation is usually based on time intervals, trying
 * to keep groups of event happening in a certain time-slice together.
 * All conforming input modules keep to this rule, with *one* possible
 * exception: for example IMU6 and Frame packets cannot guarantee this
 * always; it is possible that *one* such event is moved to the successive
 * packet container, since these are composite events and can take a long
 * time to be completed/created, and in that time any of the other packet
 * container commit triggers may happen, and waiting is not an option to
 * maintain those contracts, and thus the event may be incomplete at that
 * time and has to be deferred to the next packet container."
 *
 * Understanding this gives a simple solution to the problem above: if we
 * see all the packets contained in a packet container, which is the case
 * for each run through of the cAER mainloop (as it fetches *one* new packet
 * container each time from an input module), we only have to also see the
 * next packet container from that input module; at which point we can order
 * the packets of the first container correctly (with maybe some of the second
 * container interspersed in), and write them out to a file descriptor.
 * Then we just rinse and repeat with the remaining packets of the second
 * container, and its own successor.
 * The assumption of one run of the mainloop getting at most one packet
 * container from each Source is correct with the current implementation,
 * and future designs of Sources should take this into account! Delays in
 * packet containers getting to the output module are still allowed, provided
 * the ordering doesn't change and single packets aren't mixed, which is
 * a sane restriction to impose anyway.
